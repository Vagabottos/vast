    - name: Revealing Dark Tiles
      pretext: >
        During play, Dark tiles will be revealed— flipped to their Lit side—through various means, such as the Knight entering Dark tiles, the Dragon using the Flame power, or any player using the **Flare** card.
        <br><br>

        Some roles state additional placement rules. If your role’s placement rules conflict with the rules given here, you only need to satisfy the role’s placement rules. However, if you can satisfy both sets of rules, you must do so.
        <br><br>

        When you reveal a Dark tile, before resolving anything else, you must resolve the following steps:
        <br>


          1. **Orient the tile**. Rotate the tile to an orientation of your choice, but at least one open edge of the revealed tile must connect to the Entrance tile through open edges _(ignore this requirement if it is impossible to fulfill)_. If multiple tiles would be revealed simultaneously, reveal and orient the affected tiles one at a time, placing one before revealing the next. You choose the order in which to reveal them.


          2. **Fill open edges**. Fill all new open edges with Dark tiles, which are provided by the Cave player, if any. If there is no Cave player, you draw tiles from the Cave tile stack. Once the Collapse has begun, do not fill open edges for the remainder of the game.


        <br>
        After following these steps for all tiles to  be revealed, resolve the effects of revealing  those tiles, as needed (see the Knight’s rules),  and then resume play.

    - name: The Collapse
      pretext: >
        Once all Cave tiles have been placed on the  map, the Collapse begins at the beginning  of the next player’s turn.
        <br><br>

        During the Collapse, do not fill open edges  on revealed tiles. Also, during the Shape the  Cave phase of the Cave player’s turn, rather  than adding a tile to the map, the Cave player  removes 3 tiles from the map. If there is no  Cave player, then at the end of each player’s  turn, the current player removes 3 tiles  from the map.
        <br><br>

        When selecting tiles to remove for the  Collapse, first remove tiles that touch only  one tile, then remove tiles that touch only  two tiles. If there are multiple eligible tiles,  the player removing the tiles chooses which  to remove, but if a revealed Crystal tile can  be removed, it must be removed first. If a Dark  tile is removed, reveal it to check whether  it is a Crystal tile.
        <br><br>

        **If 5 Crystal tiles have been removed, the  game ends and the Cave player wins _(if  there is no Cave player, all players lose)_.**
        <br><br>

        The Entrance tile can never be removed. If  a removed tile holds any tokens, return them  to their owning players. If a removed tile  holds a player piece, it is forced to move away.  Refer to **Forced Movement** for more details.
        <br><br>

        Besides the Collapse, tiles can also be  removed from the map by the Goblins’ _Cave-In_ Secrets card and the Dragon’s Wrath power.  The _Cave-In_ card can remove any tiles on  the map regardless of location _(excluding the  Entrance tile, tiles holding player pieces, and  tiles holding Crystal tokens)_. The Wrath power  removes all tiles that it affects, determined  by rolling the Dragon die.
        <br><br>

        If _Cave-In_ or Wrath removes tiles **before** the Collapse, then first check for Crystal tiles,  remove them from the game, and then shuffle  the remaining removed tiles and place them  on the bottom of the Cave tile stack. Reconnect  the map if it was split _(see **Connecting the  Map**)_, and then place Dark tiles to fill any  open edges produced by removing tiles.
        <br><br>

        If _Cave-In_ or Wrath removes tiles **during** the  Collapse, then remove the tiles from the game  and do not fill open edges, as normal.
        <br><br>

        If a tile holding tokens is removed from  the map, then return removed Bomb tokens  to the box, and return any other tokens to  their owning players. Crystal tokens removed  during the Collapse do not count toward any  victory conditions.

    - name: Connecting the Map
      pretext: >
        Sometimes when  tiles are removed,  the map splits  into unconnected  sections. If this  happens, reconnect these sections  of the map immediately, even  before filling open edges.
        <br><br>

        The player who split the map selects one  disconnected section and slides it in one  cardinal direction, moving it until the edge  of at least one tile in the moving section  touches the edge of at least one tile in the  stationary section. Repeat this process  for any other disconnected sections, then  fill in open edges with Dark tiles, as normal.

    - name: Forced Movement
      pretext: > 
        Players will sometimes be forced to move, often when it’s not their own turn, either  when tiles are removed or through the use  of several different abilities and actions  available to other players. When this occurs,  the following guidelines always apply: 

          * Nothing can be moved onto open spaces. 


          * The Knight cannot be moved through  walls, onto Dark tiles, or onto spaces with  other players. If she enters a space with  an Event token, she must stop. (On her next  turn, she must resolve the Event token as an  Encounter, and must do so before moving.) 


          * Goblin Tribes cannot be moved through  walls or onto spaces with other players.  When forced to move, they do not lose  Population by leaving tiles. 


          * The Dragon, while underground, cannot  be moved onto spaces with other players.  When on the surface, the Dragon cannot  be moved through walls, onto Dark tiles,  or onto spaces with other players. 


          * The Thief cannot be moved through walls  or onto spaces with other players. 


          * Treasure tokens and Dragon Gems cannot  be moved through walls. They may enter  spaces with player pieces, but cannot end  their movement on these spaces. 


          * Crystal, Event, Bomb, Vault, Rockslide,  and Flamewall tokens cannot be moved.  If a player piece would be forced to move  because a tile is removed, but that player  piece cannot leave the tile following the  guidelines above, do not remove the tile. 

        If this tile would be removed by the Collapse,  remove the next eligible tile instead of this  one. When a player is forced to move because  a tile is removed, the player removing the  tile moves the player who is forced to move,  following the guidelines above. If multiple  player pieces are forced to move at once, move  them one at a time following the normal turn  order _(starting with the Knight)_. 
          
    - name: The Dragon Die
      pretext: >
        Various game effects will require  a player to roll the Dragon die to  determine whether an effect resolves  or which spaces it affects. The center  mark on the die represents the roller’s  current space, while the other eight marks  represent the surrounding spaces.  
        <br><br>

        Whenever you roll the die, apply the effect  to all white spaces on the die face. If an effect  requires affecting the center space, rolling  any of the three faces with a center mark  shown will trigger that effect.  
        <br><br>
        
        When an ability or action applies to all tiles  affected by the roll, apply the effect only  to tiles present when the roll was made.  The Dragon die does not affect open spaces _(with no tiles)_, even if the Dragon die’s effect  places tiles in previously open spaces.

          2. **Move and Act**  


        **Your turn ends when you complete these  phases**. You may choose to end your turn  without completing both phases. Before  ending your turn, you may assign any unused  Hero cubes to any statistic or to equipment  or Treasure cards that do not require  Encounters.

            Pick up all Hero cubes placed on your player  board, except those on your Grit track and  those that have been discarded. _(On your first  turn, pick up the two cubes you set near your  board during setup.)_

            - name: Hero Cubes
              pretext: >
                At any time **during your turn**, you may  allocate your Hero cubes as you choose  to increase your statistics (**Movement**,  **Perception**, and **Strength**), to use your  equipment (**Bomb**, **Bow**, **Ancient Map**,  and **Shield**), and to use any Treasure cards  you’ve acquired. You do not have to allocate  all of your Hero cubes at the same time. 
                <br><br>

                Allocating a Hero cube to a statistic track  increases that statistic to the number shown  on the space you placed the token. You must  always place Hero cubes on these tracks from  left to right, starting with the leftmost empty  space _(the second space)_.  
                <br><br>

                Allocating a Hero cube to a piece of equipment  or a Treasure card allows you to use its effect. 
                <br><br>

                A placed Hero cube remains placed until  your next Pick Up Hero Cubes phase. If you  are prompted to discard a Hero cube, place  it on the Discarded Hero Cubes space of your  player board. You can recover discarded  tokens through the _Cave Bread_ Event card.  The Knight can never lose or discard her  starting two Hero cubes. 

        - name: Move and Act
          pretext: >
            During this phase, you can move a  number of adjacent tiles equal to your  Movement, and you can spend Encounters  equal to your Perception. You can move  and spend Encounters in any order,  but you can only move while you have  any Encounters remaining. Normally, you cannot move through walls.  However, each time you use your Ancient Map  equipment, you can move through one wall. By spending an Encounter, you can take the  following actions in the following order: 
            <br><br>


              1. **Reveal and Resolve Dark Tile  (required)**

              2. **Resolve Attacks (any order): Crystals,  Dragon, Goblins, Thief** 

              3. **Collect Treasures: Dragon Gems,  Treasure Tokens** 

            By spending one Encounter, you can take any  or all of these actions. _(For example, on a Lit  tile, you could spend one Encounter to attack  the Dragon, pick up two Treasure tokens,  or do both actions.)_  
            <br><br>
            
            Anything you attack or collect must be  on your tile. 
            <br><br>
            
            If you move onto a Dark tile, you must spend  an Encounter to reveal and resolve the tile,  and then you may take any of the other  actions you wish.

              pretext: >
                When you enter a Dark tile, you **must** reveal  it—flipping it to its Lit side—place it, and  resolve it. After resolving the tile, gain 1 Grit. When you place the revealed tile, you must  connect it to the tile from which you moved.  If you moved into the Dark tile through an  open side _(no wall)_, you must place an open  side of the revealed tile against the tile from  which you moved. The Cave then adds Dark  tiles to the board on the tile’s open sides.  _(If there is no Cave player, you draw and place  the tiles instead.)_  
                <br><br>
                
                To resolve the tile, follow the tile’s  instructions below: 
                <br><br>
                
                **Event**: The Cave plays an Event card  on you. _(If there is no Cave player,  you draw and resolve an Event card  instead.)_ If you enter or begin your  turn on a tile with an Event token, you must  resolve it as if you had revealed an Event tile,  then remove the Event token from the map. 
                <br><br>
                
                **Ambush**: First, you may  immediately assign more Hero  cubes to Strength. Then, the Goblins  may attack you with a hidden Goblin Tribe if  its Strength is greater than your Strength. If a  Tribe attacks you, you lose 1 Health, the Tribe  scatters, and the Goblins’ Rage decreases by 1. 
                <br><br>
                
                **Treasure Room**: Place a Treasure  token on the tile. You may pick up the  token as part of this Encounter or  ignore it. 
                <br><br>

                **Crystal**: Place a Crystal token on the  tile. You may smash it as part of this  Encounter or ignore it. 
                <br><br>

                **Vault**: Place a Vault token on the tile.  _(Only used in games with the Thief.)_

                While the Dragon is underground, you can  enter his tile without spending an Encounter  if you do not attack him. Attacking him costs  an Encounter, as normal.
                <br><br>
                
                While the Dragon is on the surface and you  wish to enter his tile, your Strength must be  **equal to or greater than** his Armor, and you  **must** then attack him (as an Encounter).

              pretext: >
                While the Dragon is underground and  the Collapse has not begun, you can attack  him only if you use your Bomb equipment,  and you can only attack him once per turn.  If the Collapse has begun, you can attack him  without using your Bomb, but you still can  only attack him once per turn. 
                <br><br>

                If the Dragon is on the surface, you can attack  him without using your Bomb, and you can  attack him multiple times, each during a  separate Encounter, without moving. 
                <br><br>

                If you attack the Dragon, and your Strength is  greater than his Armor, your attack succeeds.  If your Strength is equal, you must roll the  Dragon die, and the attack succeeds only if the  die affects the center tile. A successful attack  causes the Dragon to lose 1 Health.  
                <br><br>

                **If the Dragon’s Health is reduced to 0,  he dies and you win the game.**

                <br><br> 

                **Dragon Gem**: Roll the Dragon die. If it affects  the center tile, you lose 2 Grit. _(It’s a trap!)_ If it  doesn’t, you gain 5 Grit. After adjusting Grit,  return the Dragon Gem token to the Dragon. 
                <br><br> 

                **Treasure Token**: The Cave draws 2 Treasure  cards, chooses one to give to you, and returns  the other to the bottom of the Treasure deck.  _(If there is no Cave player, draw the top card  from the Treasure deck.)_
                <br><br> 

                After viewing the Treasure card, you may  keep it facedown near you, or you may decline  it, removing it from the game, to gain 5 Grit.  Facedown Treasure cards can be revealed later.

            You can prevent adding any number of Goblin  discs to any Tribe by spending 1 Rage per  Tribe you affect.  
            <br><br>

            A Tribe cannot have more than 4 Goblin  discs. If the Population of one or multiple  Tribes would increase beyond 4, this causes  **overpopulation**: scatter one revealed  Tribe. If no Tribes are on the map, scatter a  hidden Tribe instead. The Tribe you scatter  does not have to be a Tribe that caused  overpopulation.

          pretext: >
            Draw Monster cards equal to the  number shown on your chosen War card, and  assign the cards as you choose to the card slots  of Tribes on your player board. The Fangs  Tribe and Eye Tribe can each hold 1 Monster,  while the Bones Tribe can hold 2 Monsters.

            If a Tribe already has a Monster, you may keep  it, or you may discard its current Monster  to assign a drawn Monster. Discard any  Monsters that you do not assign. 
            <br><br>
            
            The maximum number of Monsters you  can assign among all the Tribes equals the  Population of the Bones Tribe.
            <br><br>
            
            If the Population of the Bones Tribe is reduced  to less than the number of assigned Monster  cards, the assigned Monsters remain. However,  new Monsters cannot be assigned while the  number of assigned monsters is equal to or  greater than the Bones Tribe’s Population. 
            <br><br>
            
            If the Monster deck runs out of cards, shuffle  the discarded cards to create a new deck.

            Your hand limit is 5 cards. If you ever  draw beyond your hand limit, you must  immediately choose cards to discard until  you again hold 5 cards. _(Face-up cards count  toward your hand limit.)_ 
            <br><br>

            You may play Secrets cards at any time  **during your turn**. When you play one,  discard it unless the card states otherwise. 
            <br><br>

            If the Secrets deck runs out of cards, shuffle  the discarded cards to create a new deck.


        - name: Activate Tribes
          pretext: >
            During this phase, you may activate each  Goblin Tribe once. When you activate a Tribe,  you may move it, and then you may perform  one action with it.  
            <br><br>

            You may activate Tribes in any order, but  you must finish activating one Tribe before  activating another. 
            <br><br>

            An activated Tribe can move any number  of tiles. It can enter Lit and Dark tiles, but it  cannot move through walls. Additionally,  for every 2 Lit tiles that a Tribe exits during  the same turn, it loses 1 Population. _(Remove  a disc when leaving the second tile.)_
            <br><br>

            After completing its movement, if any, an  activated Tribe may perform one action of  your choice: Attack, Plunder, Explore, Reveal,  Hide, or its special action. 
            <br><br>

            A Tribe on your player board cannot move.  A Tribe with 0 Population cannot perform  any actions.

                A Goblin Tribe may attack the Knight, Thief,  or Dragon _(only with Ash Dragon Variant  card)_ on the same tile, and they may smash  a Crystal token on the same tile with the help  of another Tribe. 
                <br><br>

                To enter a tile with the Knight or Dragon,  the Tribe’s Strength must be greater than the Knight’s Strength or the Dragon’s Armor. 
                <br><br>
 
                If the Tribe enters a tile with the Knight, it  attacks: the Knight loses 1 Health, the Tribe  scatters, and your Rage decreases by 1. 
                <br><br>

                **If the Knights’s Health is reduced to 0,  she dies and you win the game.** 
                <br><br>

                A Tribe may always enter a tile with the Thief.  To attack the Thief, the Tribe’s Perception  must be **greater than** the Thief’s Stealth.  
                <br><br>

                When the Tribe attacks the Thief, the Thief is  killed. Your Rage decreases by 1, but the Tribe  **does not** scatter. Then, you choose whether to  draw Secrets cards or gain Rage based on his  Loot Drop Level.
                <br><br>
 
                Smashing a Crystal token requires a  combined attack by two Tribes, which must  each have a Strength of 3 or more. To make  this combined attack, two Tribes must each  use the Attack action, attacking the Crystal  token, before your turn ends.  
                <br><br>

                When your Tribes smash a Crystal token,  give it to the Knight. If there is no Knight,  keep it on your player board. Also, scatter  both attacking Tribes, and decrease your  Rage by 1.

                A Tribe may plunder a Treasure token  or Dragon Gem token on its tile.

                When a Tribe plunders a Treasure token,  increase your Rage by 1, then return the token  to the Cave’s supply.  
                <br><br>

                When a Tribe plunders a Dragon Gem, roll  the Dragon die. If the roll affects the center  tile, the Tribe scatters. _(It’s a trap!)_ If it does  not, increase your Rage by 1. Then, return  the Dragon Gem to the Dragon’s supply. 
                <br><br>

                A Tribe may plunder a Dragon Gem from the  Dragon himself, but only if there are no Dragon  Gems on the map and if the Tribe’s Strength is  **greater than** the Dragon’s Armor.

                A Goblin Tribe on a Dark tile can use this  action. Select an adjacent open space _(no tile)_,  and the Cave places a Cave tile there, Dark  side up. _(If there is no Cave player, draw a Cave  tile and place it there, Dark side up.)_ Then,  place the exploring Tribe on that tile.

                Any Tribe on the map is a **revealed Tribe**.  
                <br><br>

                To reveal a hidden Tribe, move its Goblin  Tribe piece from your player board onto any  Dark tile showing that Tribe’s symbol. 
                <br><br>

                If there are no such Dark tiles on the map, you  may instead place the Tribe on an open space  (no tile) adjacent to any other tile. This Tribe  is **lurking**.
                <br><br>

                A lurking Tribe is still hidden. On any turn  after a lurking Tribe is placed on the map, you  may activate it to move it or to perform the  Hide action. If you move a lurking Tribe, it can  move only from its open space to an adjacent  tile of your choice, ending its movement there,  and it cannot perform an action after moving. 
                <br><br>

                If a tile is placed under a lurking Tribe,  the Tribe becomes revealed.

                <br><br>
                
                Hidden Tribes cannot be targeted by other  players, but they can attack the Knight if she  reveals an Ambush tile or Ambush Event card.

                **Fangs Tribe**: Increase Rage by 1.

            <br><br>

            During this phase, you may also use **powers**.  To use a power, discard Power cards that  show the Power symbols matching all those  shown for the power on your player board.  You may use any powers you wish, each as  many times as you wish, as long as you spend  the Power symbols required by each.  
            <br><br>

            You may also spend Power symbols from  Dragon Gems on the map. Each Gem’s Power  symbol can be spent only once per turn, and  spending a symbol does not remove its Gem  from the map. _(If desired, you can flip a Gem  facedown to indicate that its Power symbol has  been spent this turn. Flip these Gems face-up  again at the end of your turn.)_

        <br><br>

        When you fulfill a Sloth condition, move  a Sloth cube on that Sloth track to your  Wakefulness track. You may move up to 3  Sloth cubes per turn, but only 1 Sloth cube per  Sloth track. _(All three Pride conditions are part  of the Pride track.)_

        During your turn, resolve the following  phases in order: 


          1. **Assign Stat Tokens** 

          2. **Move and Take Actions** 

        Your turn ends when you run out of  Movement or Action cubes, or if you choose  to do nothing else. At the end of your turn,  remove all Action cubes from your board.

            <br><br>

            After assigning your Stat tokens, place Action  cubes equal in number to your Thievery onto  your board. Your Stat tokens remain placed  until you reassign them on your next turn.

            You may, in any order, move by spending  Movement and take actions by spending  Action cubes from your player board. 
            <br><br>

            Each action costs one or more Action cubes.  Spending more Action cubes will improve the  action’s effectiveness or its chance of success.
            <br><br>

            You can take an action any number of times,  as long as you pay the required Action cubes.  
            <br><br>

            You may enter Lit and Dark tiles as well  as tiles occupied by other players. However,  you cannot cross walls or impassable terrain  _(see the Terrain Tiles chapter)_ unless you use  the Climb action. 
            <br><br> 

            If you have ended your movement for the turn  and you are on a Dark tile, you may peek at  it and you may reveal it, orienting it as you  choose. _(If you reveal an Ambush tile, the  Goblins do not attack you, and they do not  attack the Knight if she later moves onto it.)_ 
            <br><br>

            You can only target each other player with  an action once per turn, and you can only  target another player with an action if  your Stealth is greater than that player’s  Perception. _(Read the Interacting with Others  section for more details.)_

                If this action succeeds, take a Treasure token  from the Cave’s supply. Also, if you succeeded,  harm the target as follows: 
                <br><br>

                When you pickpocket the **Knight**, you  may choose one Treasure card (revealed or  a random unrevealed) to move to the bottom  of its deck. If the Knight has no Treasures,  she cannot be targeted with this action. 
                <br><br>

                When you pickpocket a **Goblin Tribe**, you  may take 1 Secrets card. (You can take any  unrevealed card. The only face-up card you can  take is the Goblin Ruby.) If the Goblins have no  Secret cards that you can take, they cannot be  targeted with this action. 
                <br><br>

                When you pickpocket the **Dragon**, move 1  Sloth cube from his Wakefulness track to his  Greed track. If there is no space available  on his Greed track, the Dragon cannot be  targeted with this action.

                <br><br>

                **Upgrade: Lock Picking Kit**. Using the Lock  Pick action costs 1 fewer Action cube.

                If this action succeeds, remove the Vault token  and take a Treasure token from the Cave’s  supply. You may attempt to open each Vault  only once per turn.

            When you acquire a Treasure or Dragon  Gem token, place it on your Unstashed Tokens  space. You must carry it back to the Entrance  tile to stash it. Each carried Treasure or  Dragon Gem token reduces your Stealth by 1.  
            <br><br>

            If you enter the Entrance tile, after resolving  any effects on it, you stash all your Treasure  and Dragon Gem tokens. 
            <br><br>
            
            When you stash a Dragon Gem, return it to the  Dragon and take a Treasure token from the  Cave’s supply, which you will stash. When you  stash a Treasure token, place it on an upgrade  space on your board, and set the Loot Drop  Level on your player board to Level 3.
            <br><br>

            Next, choose two dice and set aside the  third die _(it will not be used on this turn)_.  The die with the higher value is your  **movement points**, and the die with the  lower value is your **attack points**.

        Whenever you draw a Terror card,  place it face-up near your player board.
        <br><br> 

        Each Terror card has two effects:  

          * A **persistent** effect or a **once per  turn** effect. 

          * A **once per game** effect. 

        A persistent effect applies every time  its trigger condition is met. 
        <br><br>

        Once you resolve a card’s once per game  effect, you must remove the card from  the game. If you resolve a once per game  effect that begins with “During this  turn,” remove the card from the game at  the end of your turn. 
        <br><br>

        You cannot use both of a card’s effects  on the same turn, and you cannot use  the once per game effect of identical  cards on the same turn. 
        <br><br>

        _(For example, you may use the once per  game effect of a Chase card and the once  per game effect of a Hunt card on the  same turn, but cannot use the one per  game effect of two Chase cards.)_ 
        <br><br>

        Some effects require that you  spend movement points. This is  abbreviated to “movement” to  save space.

      pretext: >
        At the end of your turn, your remaining  attack points become your defensive  attribute: Defense. After resolving any  attack, shot, or effect listed below,  you immediately skitter unless  otherwise noted. 
        <br><br>
        
        **The Knight** can enter your space only  if her Strength is greater than your  Defense. If she enters your space, she  attacks you. This attack completes her  Daring Sidequest card. It also completes  her Stalwart Sidequest if your Defense  was 3 or greater. It also completes her  Fearless Sidequest if you were on a Dark  tile that she just revealed. She may shoot you with her Bow if her  Strength is 2 or greater. 
        <br><br>

        **A Goblin Tribe** can enter your space  only if its Strength is greater than your  Defense. If it enters your space, it attacks  you. The Goblins gain 1 Rage _(instead of  losing 1)_, and the Tribe does not scatter. 
        <br><br>

        While underground, **the Dragon** can  enter your space freely. While on the  surface, the Dragon can enter your  space only if his Armor is greater than your Defense. He may attack you using  Claw or Scratch. 

          * Claw counts as the Dragon eating  1 Goblin. 

          * Scratch counts as the Dragon eating  3 Goblins and forces you to discard  1 Terror card. 

          * Hiss does not affect you. 

          * If you enter a space with a Flame  Wall, you skitter but are otherwise  unaffected. 

        **The Unicorn** can enter your space  freely. When he enters your space, he  attacks you. If the Unicorn attacks while  he has 3 Anger, you must discard  1 Terror card. 
        <br><br>

        **The Cave** can target you with Soporific  Spores to reduce your Fury by 1 _(you do  not lose any Terror cards)_. 
        <br><br>

        **The Thief** can enter your space only  if his Stealth is **greater than** your  Defense. He can attack you with  Pickpocket or Backstab. 

          * When he uses Pickpocket, he may  choose to steal a Treasure token from  your player board or to discard a  Terror card, shuffling it back into the  Terror deck. _(If you do not have any  Treasure tokens or Terror cards,  he cannot Pickpocket you.)_ 

          * When he uses Backstab, it reduces  your Movement during your next  turn by 1 for each Action cube  he spends. _(If this reduces your  movement points to 0, you cannot  move.)_ Place the Thief’s Action cubes  on your player board as a reminder,  and return them to the Thief after  adjusting your movement points  during your turn.

      pretext: >
        You cannot be forced to move  through walls or onto spaces that  hold other players.

      pretext: >
        After you resolve an attack, or after  you are attacked by another player,  you immediately skitter. 
        <br><br>

        The player whom you attacked, or who  attacked you, announces a Dark tile  symbol _(Fangs, Bones, or Eye)_ that is  shown on any unoccupied Dark tile  on the map. Then, you must place your  figure on any unoccupied Dark tile  showing the matching symbol. 
        <br><br>

        If the attack did not involve another  player _(for example, if you smash a  Crystal in a game with no Cave player,  or if you are attacked by the non-player  Shadow Unicorn)_, then you must place  your piece on any unoccupied Dark tile  whose symbol matches the top tile of  the Cave tile stack. During the Collapse,  randomly select a Dark tile symbol  using tiles that have already collapsed. 
        <br><br>

        If there are no unoccupied Dark tiles  on the map _(usually due to the Collapse)_,  you must instead place the Ghoul on  any unoccupied space surrounding  the Entrance tile.

        - name: Skitter Variant
          pretext: >
            Some groups may want the Ghoul  to move further when it skitters, or  may want to give opposing players  more input. This variant switches the  choices of the players involved in an  attack. Players must agree during setup  whether to use this variant, and the  variant rules must be used for  the entire game. 
            <br><br>

            In this variant, when the Ghoul skitters,  the Ghoul chooses a Dark symbol  _(Fangs, Bones, or Eye)_ matching an  unoccupied Dark tile, and then the  opposing player in the attack places the  Ghoul piece on any unoccupied Dark tile  showing the matching symbol.  
            <br><br>

            If there are no unoccupied Dark tiles  on the map, the opposing player may  place the Ghoul piece on any unoccupied  space surrounding the Entrance tile.  Use the standard skitter rules for  attacks not involving another player.


    - name: Terrain
      pretext: >
        The Ghoul interacts with Terrain tiles  as follows: 

          * When you enter the River, you may  immediately move for free in the  direction of the current. 

          * You may move through Pits,  spending movement points normally. 

          * You cannot enter the impassable  spaces of the Canyon. 

          * If you end your turn on Magma, you  skitter but are otherwise unaffected.

            Otherwise, slide the die from the left  side of the dice chart to the right side  of the same row. Do not move any dice  already on the right side. 
            <br><br>

            First, select one die from your supply  _(do not roll it)_ and place it on the  matching die face on the dice chart. 
            <br><br>

            The selected row lists your **Movement**  and **Attack** for this turn. Any dice on the  right side of the selected row are **Boost  dice**, which you can spend during the  Move and Act phase of this turn. 
            <br><br>

            Place Ghoul discs equal in number  to your Attack on the Attack space on  your player board. _(You won’t spend  these Ghoul discs, but they do provide  a helpful reminder of your Attack  to the other players.)_

            This phase works identically to the  Move and Act phase of the Ghoul, except  for the following changes. 
            <br><br>

            Instead of spending attack points, your  Attack remains constant throughout  your turn, except for temporary  bonuses that you add by spending **Boost  dice** and using the effects of the Hunt Terror card. 
            <br><br>

            You can spend Boost dice to gain  various bonuses during this phase.  When you spend a Boost die, do not  remove it from its space. It remains  there, but it cannot be spent again on  this turn.

                You can spend Boost dice in place  of movement points. 
                <br><br>

                You can enter a space with another  player piece, but you must spend  +1 movement point to do so if your  Attack is less than or equal to that  player’s defense statistic _(Strength,  Armor, or Stealth)_ or if you choose not  to immediately attack that player piece.
                <br><br>
 
                To add a temporary bonus to your  Attack, you can spend Boost dice or use  effects from your Hunt Terror cards.  This bonus lasts only for the current  movement and the immediate attack  upon entering a space. _(Do not add Ghoul  discs to your Attack space.)_

                <br><br>


                If you added a temporary bonus to  your Attack in order to move into  your current space, the temporary  bonus persists until you complete  your attack. 
                <br><br>

                To smash a Crystal, you must have  at least 3 Attack. 
                <br><br>
                
                Your attack deals the same effects  as the Ghoul’s attack, except for three  differences: 
                <br><br>


                Do not remove Ghoul discs from your  Attack space. Your Attack remains  constant throughout your turn. 
                <br><br>

                The Knight must lose 1 Health. 
                <br><br>

                If you have a victory condition of  killing the player whom you are  attacking, they must choose to lose  Health as the result of the attack.

        Use the Nightmare Unicorn board. Using  the Tracking cubes, set your Health to 5 and  your Anger to 1. Then, place Unicorn cubes  on the 12 spaces of the Radiance track. Keep  the remaining cubes in a supply near your  player board.

        At the start of your first turn, place the  Unicorn piece on a Lit tile adjacent to the  Knight, facing directly away from the Knight.  If there is no Knight, instead place the  Unicorn piece on the Entrance tile facing in  any cardinal direction, away from other  player pieces if possible. If no valid Lit tile is  available and the Entrance is occupied by  another player piece, place the Unicorn piece  on an unoccupied Dark tile adjacent to the  Entrance tile, and reveal the Dark tile.

        Each turn, resolve the following phases  in order: 

          1. **Perform Actions**

          2. **Replace Hand and Reset Anger** 
          
        Your turn ends when you complete these phases.

      children:
        - name: Perform Actions
          pretext: >
            During this phase, you may perform actions by playing cards from your hand. You may  perform a number of actions per turn up to  your Pace. _(You may track your actions by  using extra Unicorn cubes in your supply.)_
            <br><br>

            When you have performed actions equal in  number to your Pace, or if you choose to stop  performing actions, move to the next phase. 
            <br><br>

            The Unicorn has three actions: Move, Turn,  and Teleport. You must complete an action  before starting another. 
            <br><br>

            To Move or Turn, you must play a card that  shows “Move” or “Turn.” After you resolve the  action, discard the card. 
            <br><br>

            Teleport works differently, since “Teleport”  is not shown on any cards. To Teleport, you  must play any two cards at once. Refer to  Teleportation for more details.
            <br><br> 

            Some Unicorn cards show an angry action.  When you play an angry action, first increase  your Anger by 1, then perform the listed  action _(Move or Turn)_. 
            <br><br>

              * During an angry action, you cannot mark  Crystal tiles with Unicorn cubes or collect  Treasures. _(Thus, you do not gain Radiance  by doing so.)_ 

              * As your Anger increases, your attacks deal  more harm to other players.  _(Refer to Attacking for more details.)_ 
              
              * Your Anger cannot exceed 3. 

            As you perform actions, you will have the  chance to mark Crystal tiles with your  Unicorn cubes and to collect Treasure tokens,  both of which increase your Radiance. (Refer  to Radiance and Upgrades for more details.)

              pretext: >
                Move your piece forward (in the direction you  are facing) by the number of spaces listed on  the card. You must move as many spaces as  possible, up to the listed distance. 
                <br><br>

                Whenever you enter a Dark tile, reveal it. 
                <br><br>

                When you orient this tile, you must  connect an open edge to the tile from  which you entered. 
                <br><br>

                If you haven’t finished your Move, you  must also orient this tile so you can move  into the next space in a straight line, if  possible. If you cannot orient the tile so  you can move out of it, you stop moving. 
                <br><br>

                Whenever you enter a space that holds  another player piece, you immediately attack  it. _(Refer to Attacking for more details.)_ 
                <br><br>

                If you end a Move on a Crystal tile that does  not hold a Unicorn cube, you may place a  Unicorn cube on it to gain 1 Radiance. 
                <br><br>

                If you end a Move on a space with a Treasure  token, you may collect it to gain 1 Radiance. 
                <br><br>

                Outside your turn, you **cannot** mark Crystal  tiles with cubes or collect Treasures, so you  cannot gain Radiance.

                If you are on a Crystal tile without a Unicorn  cube, you may also place a Unicorn cube on it  to gain 1 Radiance. 
                <br><br>

                If your space contains a Treasure token, you  may also collect it to gain 1 Radiance.


        - name: Replace Hand and Reset Anger 
          pretext: >
            Discard all Unicorn cards in your hand,  then draw cards equal in number to your  Spirit. Whenever your Unicorn deck is empty,  shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck  before drawing. Then, reset your Anger to 1. 


    - name: Attacking
      pretext: >
        **You attack immediately when you enter a  space that holds another player piece**. If  a space holds multiple players, you choose  which one to attack. Your attack always  succeeds, regardless of the defending player’s  statistics (such as Armor or Stealth). 
        <br><br>

        **When you attack, you deal the following  effect** based on your Anger: 

          * **The Knight** loses 1 / 3 / 5 Grit. 

          * **A Goblin Tribe** scatters / +Discards a  Secrets card / ++Population is reduced to 0.  _(These effects are cumulative.)_ 

          * **The Dragon** discards 1 / 2 / 3 Power cards.

          * **The Thief** is killed, and you draw cards  equal to his Loot Drop Level + 0 / 1 / 2. At 3  Anger, the Thief also loses an upgrade _(but  keeps the Treasure token)_. 

          * **The [Vile] Ghoul** skitters. At 3 Anger, it  also discards a Terror card. 

        **If your Anger is 3, you also gain 1 Radiance. After attacking, you are forced to Teleport.** 
        <br><br>

        You can attack the same player multiple times  per turn, but you only gain 1 Radiance the first  time you attack that player on each turn. 
        <br><br>

        **Other clarifications to attacking players**: 

          * If the Goblins have the **Trap** card face-up  and choose to discard it, the targeted Tribe  ignores the attack. You are still forced to  Teleport, but you do not gain Radiance. 

          * If the Thief has the Unnatural Evasion  upgrade and rolls successfully, he ignores  the attack. After the Thief moves 1 space  away, you are forced to Teleport, but you  do not gain Radiance. 
          
          * When you attack the [Vile] Ghoul, you are  forced to Teleport **after** it skitters. 

    - name: Other Players
      pretext: >
        Other players may choose to attack you. If the attacker has the victory condition of  killing you, the attack causes you to lose 1  Health. After resolving the attack, you are  forced to Teleport. 

          * **The Knight** can enter your space only if  her Strength is equal to or greater than  your Armor. If she enters your space, she  attacks you. If her Strength is greater, the  attack succeeds. If her Strength is equal,  she must roll the Dragon die, and the  attack succeeds only if the die affects the  center space. 

          * **A Goblin Tribe** can enter your space only  if its Strength is greater than your Armor.  If it enters your space, it attacks you. 

          * **The Dragon** can enter your space freely,  and he can freely attack you with Claw or  Scratch. Claw counts as eating 1 Goblin,  Scratch counts as eating 3 Goblins. Hiss  does not affect you. If you enter a space  with a Flame Wall, you are forced  to Teleport. 

          * **The Thief** can enter your space freely.  If his Stealth is greater than your Armor,  he can attack using Backstab by spending  3 Action cubes. The Thief cannot attack  you with Pickpocket. 

          * **The [Vile] Ghoul** may spend movement  points to enter your space regardless of its  Attack, but it can attack you if its number  of spent Ghoul discs (Ghoul) or Attack (Vile  Ghoul) is greater than your Armor (you  are forced to Teleport after it skitters). 

        Other changes and clarifications to rules  for other players are listed below: 

          * **The Knight** may complete her Daring Sidequest by attacking you. She may shoot  you with the Enchanted Bow to force you to  discard Unicorn cards, as if shooting the  Dragon. After she resolves the shot, you are  forced to Teleport. She may use the Mighty  Axe for the Strength bonus, but cannot  discard a Hero cube to increase damage. 

          * **The Goblins** may target you with Hex to  force you to discard cards, as if targeting  the Dragon. 

          * **The Cave** may target you with Soporific  Spores to remove one upgrade of your  choice (but you do not lose Radiance). The  Cave cannot affect you with Giant Bats.

    - name: Teleportation
      pretext: >
        The Unicorn can Teleport, moving from  one space to another while ignoring all  walls, effects, and player pieces on spaces  in between. There are two ways to Teleport:  you can **use the Teleport action**, and you  can **be forced to Teleport**. If a rule refers to  “Teleport” alone without stating “the Teleport  action” or “forced to Teleport,” the rule refers  to both cases. 
        <br><br>

        Each Unicorn card shows a grid with the  Unicorn in the center space, which is your  current space. The other spaces correspond  to the surrounding spaces, and the marked  space indicates the destination space of the  Teleport. When Teleporting, orient the chosen  card so the arrow (^) above the grid points in  the same direction as the facing of your piece. 
        <br><br>
        
        When you Teleport, pick up your piece and  place it on the destination space, without  changing your piece’s orientation. 
        <br><br>
        
        Next, if you are on a Dark tile, reveal it  as if you had moved into it. 
        <br><br>
        
        Then, if your space holds another player  piece, you attack it. _(The attack will force you  to Teleport again, so you won’t continue  to the next step for this Teleport.)_ 
        <br><br>
        
        Finally, **only during your turn**, if you are on  a Crystal tile without a Unicorn cube, you may  place a Unicorn cube to gain 1 Radiance, and  if you are on a space with a Treasure token,  you may collect it to gain 1 Radiance.

            You can perform the Teleport action by  playing two cards at once. Choose your  destination from either card, and place your  piece there. Ignore the destination on the  other card. 

              * Do not perform the actions listed on these  cards (Move or Turn). 

              * Do not gain Anger, even if the played cards  show angry actions. 

              * If you have only one card in your hand,  you cannot perform the Teleport action. 

              * Though you play two cards to Teleport,  it costs only one action. 

            Before the Collapse, you can use the Teleport  action to move to an open space. When you do,  you must place a Dark tile there, connect that  space to the map using the fewest possible  Dark tiles, reveal the destination Dark tile,  and then place your piece there. (All Dark tiles  are provided by the Cave player, if present.) 
            <br><br>

            During the Collapse, you cannot use the  Teleport action to move to open spaces. 

        - name: Forced Teleport
          pretext: >
            When you are forced to Teleport, draw and  reveal Unicorn cards equal in number to  your Clarity, choose your destination from  one revealed card, place your piece there, and  then discard the cards you revealed. 
            <br><br>

            You cannot be forced to Teleport to an open  space. If none of the revealed cards show a  valid destination, reveal more cards, one at  a time, until you find a valid destination.  


    - name: Radiance and Upgrades
      pretext: >
        Radiance represents the Unicorn’s power,  which he drains from the other players.  There are three ways to gain Radiance: 

          * If you attack another player while at  3 Anger, gain 1 Radiance after resolving  the attack. 

          * During your turn, if you end a non-angry  Move, Turn, or Teleport on a Crystal tile  _(even if it is smashed)_ that does not hold a  Unicorn cube, you may place a Unicorn  cube there to gain 1 Radiance. 

          * During your turn, if you end a non angry Move, Turn, or Teleport on a space  with a Treasure token, you may collect it  to gain 1 Radiance, returning the Treasure  to the Cave. You may collect multiple  Treasure tokens on a space, gaining  1 Radiance each. 

        If a Crystal tile with a Unicorn cube is  collapsed, remove the cube with the tile, but  do not return a cube to your Radiance track. 
        <br><br>

        **Each time you gain Radiance**, remove  a Unicorn cube from your Radiance track  and place it on an upgrade space. 

          * An upgrade to **Spirit**, **Pace**, **Armor**, or  **Clarity** immediately increases that  statistic by the amount shown. _(If you  upgrade Spirit, wait until the Replace Hand  and Reset Anger phase to draw more cards.)_ 

          * The **Unbridled** upgrade increases your  Anger by 1 immediately. Also, during the  Replace Hand and Reset Anger phase, your  Anger resets to 2 (not 1). 

          * The **Displacement Blast** upgrade gives  you the Displacement Blast action. To  perform this action, play a card but do not  resolve its listed action. Instead, remove  the marked tile shown on the card. You can  only perform the Displacement Blast  action once per turn. 

        **You win if you gain 9 Radiance and then  escape the Cave by entering the Entrance tile.**

    - name: Forced Movement
      pretext: >
        When forced to move, rather than forced  to Teleport, you cannot be moved through  walls, onto Dark tiles, or onto spaces with  other players. 
        <br><br>

        If collapsing tiles would force you to move,  you are instead forced to Teleport. 

    - name: Terrain
      pretext: >
        The Unicorn interacts with Terrain tiles  as follows:  


          * If you enter the **River**, you may immediately  move for free in the direction of the current,  as normal. If you move into the River during  a Move, this free movement does not count  against the listed number of spaces for  your Move. 

          * If you end any Move or Teleport on **Magma**  or a **Pit**, you are only forced to Teleport  and are otherwise unaffected. You cannot  move directly from one Pit to another.

          * You cannot enter the impassable spaces  on the **Canyon**, even with Teleport. 

          * You cannot Teleport onto a **Mushroom  Forest** space that holds another player.  If you are inside the Mushroom Forest,  you cannot Teleport onto any space that  holds another player, even a space outside  the Mushroom Forest. 


    - name: Simple Teleport Variant
      pretext: >
        Inexperienced players or players who prefer  a simpler system can use this variant of the  Teleport rules. You may decide to use this  variant freely during setup. If you wish to  switch to this variant or to the normal rules  during play, you must announce this switch at  the end of the Perform Actions phase. 
        <br><br>

        In this variant, instead of matching the arrow  (^) of the played card to the orientation of  the Unicorn piece, face the arrow (^) directly  away from your seating position at the  table. While this variant will reduce your  options somewhat, it drastically reduces the  complexity of planning movement.

        If any Possession cards in the deck refer to  Flare, take the Flare Variant card. If other  players also get Flare, place the card near  the map; each of those players may use it. 
        Distribute Artifact tokens as follows: 
        <br>
            

          * **Three or more players**: Give 1 Artifact  token to each other player 


          * **Solo or two players**: Place all Artifact  tokens on the Entrance tile. 

        At the start of your first turn, place the Ghost  piece on any unoccupied Dark tile. If no such  tile exists, place a Dark tile (provided by the  Cave, if present) and place the Ghost piece there.

            If there is an unrevealed  Possession card on the  Possession space of your player  board, gain 1 Focus. 
            <br><br>
            
            Then, if the unrevealed card is  the Ghost card, you can reveal it  to gain its listed bonuses to your  Movement and Influence until  the end of your turn.  
            <br><br>
            
            You **cannot** reveal this card if  any player piece is on a Ghost tile  with a locked Artifact.

                You may move a number of spaces  up to your Movement. 
                <br><br>

                You may move through walls and into any  spaces, including open spaces, freely and  without effect. _(Other players may also enter your space freely and without effect.)_  However, you cannot end this phase on an  open space, a space with any Artifacts,  or a space with player pieces who carry  any Artifacts. 

            - name: Telekinesis
              pretext: >
                You may use Telekinesis to move an object  _(token or other player piece)_ that is orthogonal  _(not diagonal)_ from you, whether or not it is  visible to you. 
                <br><br>
                
                You may move an object in a straight line  away from or toward your space, including  into your space. _(Thus, you can move an object  into your space, and then move it away from  your space in a different direction.)_ 
                <br><br>
                
                Your Influence equals the number of  different objects that you can move per turn,  and it also equals the total number of spaces  that you can move each such object per turn. 
                <br><br>
                
                You can split up an object’s total spaces  of movement into multiple moves during  your turn, as long as its total movement  throughout your turn does not exceed your  Influence. _(For example, with 3 Influence, you  could move an object one space, move your  piece, and then move the same object two more  spaces. Later in your turn, you could move up to two other objects, each up to three spaces.)_ 
                <br><br>
                
                Objects moved with Telekinesis must obey  the Forced Movement rules.
                <br><br>

                A non-locked Artifact can be moved into  Dark or Lit tiles and into spaces that hold  other player pieces. It can be moved into  your space, but cannot end this phase  there. It can be moved through a wall if  you have at least 3 Influence and if you  have not yet moved it during this turn.  Once you move a non-locked Artifact  through a wall, you cannot move it  further during the same turn. 
                <br><br>

                Crystal, Event, Vault, and Bomb tokens cannot be moved. 
                <br><br>

                The Knight cannot be moved if she has  a Hero cube assigned to her Shield

        - name: Select Possession Card

            Collect all Possession cards except the card  _(if any)_ on your Mental Block space. _(If you  wish, you may show off the Possession card  that was on your Possession space.)_ 
            <br><br>

            Then, choose and place a Possession card  facedown on your Possession space, and set  aside the other Possession cards facedown. 


    - name: Taking a Possession Turn
      pretext: >
        At the end of another player’s turn, you  may reveal the Possession card on your  Possession space _(not your Mental Block  space)_ if the card matches that player. 
        <br><br>

        _(For example, you may reveal the Possessed  Dragon at the end of the Dragon’s turn.)_ 
        <br>

          * You cannot reveal the Possession card  if any player piece is on a Ghost tile  with a locked Artifact _(so you cannot  take a possession turn)_. 

          * In games without the Cave player, the  player taking a turn places or collapses  tiles before the Ghost chooses to reveal  a Possession card. 

        When you reveal a matching Possession  card, you begin a possession turn. 
        <br><br>

        **Rules**: You play the turn from its beginning,  following the normal rules for the role.  However, you must use the statistics  and follow the restrictions listed on the  Possession card _(not the possessed player’s  statistics)_. Track the role’s victory conditions  and other states _(Grit, Wakefulness, Fury,  etc.)_ as normal unless noted otherwise  on the Possession card. 
        <br><br>

        **Components**: If you are prompted to gain  or use components of the possessed player  _(such as drawing cards)_, take them from the  appropriate deck or supply, not from the  player. At the end of your possession turn,  you must discard unused cards and return  unused components to their supplies.
        <br><br>

        **Use Limits**: The possession turn is not a  separate turn, so you continue to follow any  limits on the number of times that actions  and effects can be used per turn, counting  any actions and effects used by the possessed  player during their normal turn. 
        <br><br>

        _(For example, the possessed Dragon cannot  remove a second Pride cube for revealing  an Event tile if the Dragon player already  removed a cube during his turn, the possessed  Thief cannot target the same player with  Backstab a second time, and the possessed Cave must spend more Omen tokens to use  omens such as Hatred and Past Plunder if they  were used during the Cave player’s turn.)_ 
        <br><br>

        **Information**: You do not gain access to  private information held by the possessed  player, such as cards in their own hand,  except for the Cave’s hand of tiles _(as  described on its card)_. 
        <br><br>

        **Dice**: If a Possession card prompts you to roll  more dice than there are available for use or  are included in the game, you can substitute  dice or reroll dice to represent the additional  dice you need to roll. 
        <br><br>

        _(For example, if the Possessed Ghoul prompted  you to roll 4 Ghoul dice, you could reroll one  die to get a fourth result, but you could choose  from all four results. Or if the Possessed Vile  Ghoul prompted you to roll 2 Ghoul dice, but  all the Vile Ghoul player’s dice were assigned  to its dice chart, you could roll the Thief die  twice and choose from the two results.)_ 


    - name: Other Players
      pretext: >
        Unless specifically noted, other players  cannot target the Ghost with attacks, powers,  or other effects. There are only two ways for  other players to affect the Ghost. 
        <br><br>

        First, if any player piece, except the Ghost,  is on a Ghost tile with a locked Artifact, the  Ghost cannot reveal a Possession card for  any purpose. _(The Cave does not have a player  piece, so it cannot block Possession cards  in this way.)_ 
        <br><br>

        Second, other players can cause a Mental  Block. During another player’s turn, if their  player piece is on the same space as the Ghost  or on an adjacent space _(ignore walls)_, that  player can cause the Ghost to have a Mental  Block by spending the following: 
        <br>

          * Knight: Lose [INF+2] Grit. 

          * Goblins: Discard [INF] Secrets cards. 

          * Dragon: Discard [INF] Power cards. 

          * Unicorn: Discard [INF] Unicorn cards.

          * Thief: Spend [INF] Action cubes. 

          * [Vile] Ghoul: Spend [INF+1] movement  points. 

        The Cave can cause a Mental Block by just affecting the Ghost with Soporific Spores. 
        <br><br>

        Once the blocking player pays for  the Mental Block, the Ghost removes the  Possession card matching the blocking  player from her Possession deck or  Possession space, and places the card face-up  in her Mental Block space. 
        <br><br>
        
        If the matching card came from the Ghost’s  Possession space, she does not take a  possession turn at the end of the matching  player’s turn, and she does not gain 1 Focus  during her next Resolve Possession Card  phase for having an unrevealed card.  
        <br><br>

        If a second card is added to her Mental  Block space, return the first card to her  Possession deck.


    - name: Artifacts
      pretext: >
        The six Artifact tokens have different  artwork, but they do not follow different  rules. At the start of the game, each Artifact  shows its side without the blue border. 
        <br><br>

        During your turn or a possession turn, if an  Artifact, or a player carrying one, enters a  Ghost tile without a locked Artifact, then  lock the Artifact to the Ghost tile, placing the  Artifact there and flipping the Artifact to its  blue-bordered side. 
        <br><br>

        Specifically, lock an Artifact in these cases: 
        <br>

          * If you use Telekinesis to move an Artifact,  or a player carrying an Artifact, onto such  a Ghost tile. 

          * If a possessed player carrying an Artifact  enters such a Ghost tile. 

          * If a possessed player forces another  player carrying an Artifact to enter such  a Ghost tile. 

        Do not lock an Artifact in these cases: 
        <br>

          * If a non-possessed player carrying an  Artifact enters such a Ghost tile on their  own turn. 

          * If a non-possessed player forces another  non-possessed player carrying an  Artifact to enter such a Ghost tile. 

        You win if you lock 5 Artifacts to Ghost  tiles, and then escape the Cave by entering  the Entrance tile.
        <br><br>

        A locked Artifact cannot be moved in any  way. If a Ghost tile with a locked Artifact is  ever removed from the map, the Artifact still  counts toward the Ghost’s victory condition. 
        <br><br>

        If an Artifact is locked during a possession  turn, the possession turn ends immediately.

      subchildren:
        - name: Collecting, Carrying, and Dropping Artifacts
          pretext: >
            Each player can carry only one Artifact.  However, the Cave and the Ghost cannot  collect or carry Artifacts. 
            <br><br>

            If the Goblins player gets an Artifact during  setup, the Artifact starts the game off the  map, and it is given to the first Tribe to  reveal. If a Tribe carrying an Artifact leaves  the map for any reason, the Artifact leaves  the map as well. Whenever the Goblins’  Artifact is off the map, give it to the next  Tribe to reveal. In total, the Goblin Tribes  can carry one Artifact, not three. 
            <br><br>

            At any time during a possession turn, the  Ghost may force the possessed player to drop  a carried Artifact onto their space. Likewise,  if the possessed player is not carrying an  Artifact, the Ghost may instead force them to  collect a non-locked Artifact on their space.  Dropping or collecting an Artifact does not  cost an action or any resource.


    - name: Ghost Tiles
      pretext: >
        Ghost tiles are a new type of  Cave tile. When the Cave has  a Ghost tile in its hand, it must  place the Ghost tile before any  other tiles _(including Crystal  tiles)_, even when another  player is taking a turn. _(In games without the  Cave player, Ghost tiles do not take priority.  They are placed exactly like other Cave tiles  when drawn from the stack.)_ 
        <br><br>

        In addition to an Ambush, Event, or Treasure  symbol, the Lit side of each Ghost tile shows a  new symbol, the Ghost symbol, which shows  that the tile can lock an Artifact. 
        <br><br>

        A Ghost tile **with a locked Artifact** may be collapsed normally. The locked Artifact still  counts toward the Ghost’s victory condition. 
        <br><br>

        Ghost tiles **without a locked Artifact** cannot be collapsed. If a Ghost tile would be removed by the Collapse, remove the next  eligible tile instead. 


    - name: Forced Movement
      pretext: >
        When forced to move _(due to collapsing tiles)_,  the Ghost cannot be moved onto spaces that  hold Artifacts. 
        <br><br>

        If a tile with a non-locked Artifact is  removed, the player who removed the  tile must move the Artifact to any  adjacent space without the Ghost.  
        <br><br>

        Artifacts cannot be moved through  walls during forced movement.

    - name: Terrain
      pretext: >
        The Ghost, possessed players, and Artifacts  interact with Terrain tiles as follows: 

          * When you or a possessed player piece  enters the **River**, you may immediately  move that piece for free in the direction  of the current. 

          * You may enter and move through **Pits**,  spending movement points as normal. You  cannot use Telekinesis to move Artifacts  onto or through Pits, but other players can  carry Artifacts onto and through Pits.

          * You may enter the impassable spaces  of the **Canyon**, but cannot end your  turn there. Artifacts cannot enter the  impassable spaces. 

          * You cannot target player pieces in the  **Mushroom Forest** with Telekinesis  or Possession. If a possessed player  piece enters the Mushroom Forest,  the possession turn ends immediately. 

          * You and Artifacts may enter **Magma** without effect. 


    - name: Possession in Two-Player and Solo Games
      pretext: >
        Set up the Possession deck as follows: 

          1. In a two-player  game, remove the  Possession card  matching the  non-Ghost player.

          2. For any position _(1–7)_ in turn order— except the position of the non-Ghost  player—that has multiple roles, randomly  remove cards from that position until  only one remains. 

          3. If the non-Ghost player shares a position  with other roles, randomly remove cards  of the other roles from that position until  only the non-Ghost player and one other  role remain. 

          4. In a solo game, remove the Ghost Possession card, so that positions 1–6  each have only one Possession card. _(For example, two players are setting up and  are playing the Ghost and Dragon. The Ghost  starts setting up her Possession deck. She  cannot possess her opponent, so she returns  the Possessed Dragon card to the box. Next,  she sets out the remaining Possession cards,  finding that the Possessed Goblins and  Possessed Vile Ghoul share position 2 in turn  order. She shuffles those two cards and draws  one, the Possessed Goblins, so she returns  the Possessed Vile Ghoul to the box. Now that  each position in turn order only has one card,  she collects them to form her Possession deck.)_ 

        The Resolve Possession Card phase works  as normal. However, If you reveal the Ghost Possession card, remove it from the game at  the end of your turn. 
        <br><br>

        The Select Possession Card phase works  as normal. 
        <br><br>

        Revealing a Possession card to begin  a possession turn works differently: 

          * If the position in turn order of the Possession  card is before the non-Ghost player, reveal  the card at the end of your turn. 

          * If the position is after, reveal the card  at the end of the non-Ghost player’s turn. _(For example, if playing against the Dragon,  you could choose the Possessed Knight card  during the Select Possession Card phase. At  the end of your turn, before the Dragon’s turn  begins, you could reveal the Possessed Knight card to begin the possession turn with the  Knight. If you instead chose the Possessed  Thief, you could reveal the card at the end  of the Dragon’s turn.)_ 

        At the start of a possession turn, place  the player piece _(if any)_ of the possessed role  on the map according to its setup rules for  placement on its first turn. It does not  begin with any Artifacts, but may collect  an Artifact from the map to carry.

          pretext: >
            Collect Omen tokens based on your Isolation  plus the number of Crystal tokens and Ghost  tiles on the map, as shown below. Do not  count those removed from the map, and do  not count Treasure tokens (as the Cave does).

        - name: Shape the Cave
          pretext: >
            Choose a tile from your hand and place it,  Dark side up, adjacent to any tile on the map.  Then, draw a new tile from tile stack and add  it to your hand. 
            <br><br>

            If you have any Crystal tiles in your hand,  you must place them before placing any  other tiles. _(Tiles placed during other players’  turns do not have to be Crystal tiles.)_
            <br><br>

            Once the last tile in your hand has been  placed, the Collapse begins on your  next turn. 

        - name: Move and Use Powers
          pretext: >
            During this phase, you may move and use  powers in any order and combination, up to the limits described in their sections.

            - name: Moving
              pretext: >
                During this phase, you may move up to  **six spaces**. 
                <br><br>

                You may move through walls and into  any spaces, including open spaces, freely  and without effect. _(Likewise, other players  may enter your space freely and without  effect.)_ However, you cannot end this  phase on an open space. 

            - name: Using Powers
              pretext: >
                You may use the powers shown on your  player board by spending Omen tokens,  following the rules for the Cave. Place spent  Omen tokens in the Past Plunder space on  your player board _(instead of returning them  to the bag)_. 
                <br><br>

                Rockslide, Hatred, and Crystal Curse function as the Cave’s same omens, except  for the following changes: 


                  * **Rockslide**: The Rockslide token can  only be placed on an edge adjacent to your space. 

                  * **Crystal Curse**: This power can only affect  a space surrounding your space. 

                  * **Hatred**: This power can only affect a  space surrounding your space. During  the Collapse, tiles you wish to remove with Hatred still follow the normal  requirement based on the number of  tiles they touch, while also needing to be  in a surrounding space. _(Tiles added or  removed during the Shape the Cave phase  do not need to be in surrounding spaces.)_ 

                **Plot Twist** lets you place a Ghost tile _(of your  choice)_, Dark side up, in a surrounding space. 
                <br><br>

                **Telekinesis** works as the Ghost’s same  ability, but you can move only one object  _(regardless of Influence)_, and the distance  you can move an object depends on your  Isolation from the target object. You may  target the same object with multiple uses  of Telekinesis _(unlike the Ghost)_. 
                <br><br>

                **Possession** works as the Ghost’s same  ability, except that you start the possession  turn immediately when you use the power  _(instead of at the end of the target player’s  turn)_, and other players cannot block it in  any way. The cost in Omen tokens to possess  a player depends on your Isolation from the  target plus the role’s Possession value _(the  number listed in the  upper corner of the  Possession card)_.  **When using this  power, treat your  Influence [INF] as 2**. 
        
        - name: Place Treasure
          pretext: >
            Place a Treasure token on a Dark tile that  does not hold a player piece or Treasure  token. If no such tile exists, do not place  the Treasure token. 

        - name: Check Past Plunder
          pretext: >
            If the Past Plunder space on your player  board holds 6 or more Omen tokens,  return 6 Omen tokens to the bag and place  a Treasure token on a Dark tile that does  not hold a player piece or Treasure token.  If no such tile exists, do not place the  Treasure token. 
            <br><br>

            Repeat this phase if 6 or more Omen tokens  remain on your Past Plunder space. 

    - name: Cave Rules
      pretext: >
        The Cave Ghost follows all of the rules for  the Cave listed in its **Cave Tiles**, **Treasures**,  and **Events** boxes, except that the Cave Ghost  cannot examine the top three cards of the  Event deck.
        <br><br>

        The Cave Ghost also follows all of the rules for  the Cave listed in its **The Collapse** section.

    - name: Ghost Tiles
      pretext: >
        Ghost tiles are a new type of  Cave tile. In addition to an  Ambush, Event, or Treasure  symbol, the Lit side of each  Ghost tile shows a new  symbol: the Ghost symbol.  
        <br><br>

        Ghost tiles on the map contribute to the  number of Omen tokens that you draw  during the Collect Omen Tokens phase.  
        <br><br>

        In games with the Cave Ghost, Ghost symbols  only show which tiles are Ghost tiles; they  have no other effect. 
        <br><br>

        If a Ghost tile is removed from the map  before the Collapse, return the tile to your  supply _(not to the bottom of a tile stack)_. 
        <br><br>

        You can place Ghost tiles by using the Plot  Twist omen. 


    - name: Isolation
      pretext: >
        The Cave Ghost’s power over entities in the  Cave and her attunement to the Cave itself  change as she becomes more or less isolated  from them. 
        <br><br>

        **Isolation** is measured in rings of  surrounding spaces, ignoring the presence  of walls, tile features, and open spaces.
        <br><br>

        During the Collect Omen Tokens phase,  measure your Isolation from the **closest  player piece**. (For example, if a Goblin Tribe is  in a space marked “2” and the Knight is in one  marked “3”, your Isolation is 2.) With **greater** Isolation, you will collect more Omen tokens. 
        <br><br>

        When using Telekinesis or Possession,  measure your Isolation from your **target**.  With **lower** Isolation, your power will be  more powerful or less expensive.

              * **Sprint**: Move up to 2 spaces. You can only enter Lit tiles with no figures that force attacks.

                    <br><br>

                    You may keep the treasure card in your hand, or you may return it to the box to gain 5 Grit.
                    <br><br>
